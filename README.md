An organized resource for all things paleontology and more specifically, paleoart.
Hi, I'm Miles. I'm creating this as a compiled resource to help not just me, but anyone who needs it easily access as much paleontological information and visuals as possible. I will try my best to use only my art, and if not credit the art to whoever made it. The latter will moreso apply for skeletal recreations and examples of specific specimens.
